How do scholars present expert research on a physical object — a manuscript, a painting, a piece of textile — to audiences who may never handle it, may not read the relevant languages, and are unlikely to encounter a conventional academic publication? This was the question at the centre of the digital storytelling initiative, which set out to develop platforms and methodologies for object-based digital narratives that could reach general audiences, students, and communities without sacrificing scholarly rigour.

The initiative grew out of [*Colonial Landscapes* (*Paisajes Coloniales*)](https://paisajescoloniales.com), an interactive bilingual platform developed by Santiago Muñoz in 2020 that explores the history of the region around Bogotá through a 1614 map. *Colonial Landscapes* demonstrated that it was possible to create a rich, accessible, pedagogically sophisticated visual narrative around a digitised object — guiding general audiences and students through the map, using its specific details as anchors for historical analysis — as a simple static website with no ongoing hosting costs. The digital storytelling initiative set out to generalise that approach, testing it through a series of collaborative scholarly projects.

The first collaborative project was *Haptic Khipu*, led by the [Material/Image Research Lab (MIRL)](https://mirl.arthistory.ucsb.edu/) in UCSB's History of Art and Architecture department, in collaboration with AMPL. Khipus — knotted-cord recording devices used across the Andes to encode numerical, administrative, and perhaps narrative information — are among the most challenging objects to study, let alone communicate: the direction of each cord's twist, the type and placement of its knots, the colour and fibre of the threads are themselves data, and a screen can only take you so far. *Haptic Khipu* drew on MIRL's work examining a 16th-century example held in UCSB's Art, Design & Architecture Museum — a gift of Dr. Stephen S. Goodspeed and Mrs. John Goodspeed Ainsworth — through material analysis, tactile examination, and high-resolution digital imaging, with the aim of understanding how Andean recordkeeping systems encoded knowledge in fibre and form.

The publication presents this research as an interactive visual narrative built with [Telar](/project/telar). Rather than a conventional article or exhibition catalogue, it guides readers through the object step by step, pairing high-resolution images with analytical observations and allowing anyone with a browser to zoom into the specific details that anchor the argument. It is freely available at [khipu.mirl.arthistory.ucsb.edu](https://khipu.mirl.arthistory.ucsb.edu). A Spanish translation is in preparation.

The other side of the project, the work to create a platform in which to create publications of this kind, eventually became [Telar](/project/telar), AMPL's open-source visual storytelling framework.
