description: "What happens when communities have the means to digitize and administer their own historical documentation? What if more people can decide what constitutes an archive: what is worth collecting, preserving, and sharing, and on what terms? How might this affect how visions and narratives of the past are written and taught in different contexts?"

This project aims to develop an integrated toolkit of hardware, software, and documentation to allow lower-resourced institutions, collectives, and communities to digitize their archival collections at low cost. 

A decade ago, the development and dissemination of "DIY" book scanning equipment dramatically reduced the cost of digitizing bound materials and made possible a broad range of digital humanities research and experimentation, including our own regionally recognized efforts to digitize endangered archives in Latin America. The cheap point-and-shoot digital cameras and single-board hobbyist computers at the heart of these designs (pictured below), however, are increasingly obsolete or unavailable.

Building on a decade of community-based digitization work in the Global South, with a [Level I Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=HAA-304052-25), we are working to update, test, evaluate, and release a prototype of a new generation of hardware and software built on sustainable, up-to-date technologies. 

In this Level I stage, we will build an alpha version of the toolkit, which we will test at the [Santa Barbara Mission Archive Library (SBMAL)](https://www.sbmal.org). 

The main outputs for this project will be: 
1. the working prototype of the hardware; 
2. alpha-level software to power it; 
3. detailed documentation; and 
4. identifying a series of potential partners, holding traditional and non-traditional collections, for future collaboration in the next stage (Level II) of this project.

We will post updates on this page as the project develops.
