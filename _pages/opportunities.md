## For graduates
Interested in archives, memory, or historical preservation? Work with a collection you'd like to help protect, or share with new audiences? Get in touch! We're always looking for opportunities to collaborate.

## For undergraduates
AMPL is always looking for interested and motivated undergraduates to join the team. Undergraduates have the opportunity to be involved in all aspects of our research, including archival digitization and description, the development and testing of tools and methods, the production of public-facing narratives to bring historical research to broad audiences, and even helping formulate new research questions. 

Undergrad research assistants are expected to work for approximately 3-6 hours per week in the lab (or remotely, depending on the project), which includes attending a weekly lab meeting. Research assistants can receive course credit. Given the amount of training involved, we usually require a two-quarter commitment. We hope research assistants will want to participate even longer, and start their own independent projects!

Details of individual roles we are looking for are detailed below, as well as on the [URCA Undergraduate Research Directory](https://ucsb.my.site.com/urca/s/urad).
